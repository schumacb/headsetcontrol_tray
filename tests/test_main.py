    # To ensure this test is isolated and actually tests the import-time behavior,
    # we need to reload the module. This is generally tricky and can have side effects.
    # A more robust way would be to structure the application so that such global setup
    # is more explicitly controllable or testable.
    # For now, we assume that by the time any test in this file runs, __main__ was imported,
    # and thus verboselogs.install() should have been called once.
    # To make this more deterministic, we could use importlib.reload if necessary,
    # but that adds complexity.

    # For simplicity, this test will rely on the fact that __main__ is imported
    # when pytest collects tests from this file. If verboselogs.install() was
    # decorated with @mock.patch at the top of the file BEFORE the import of hct_main,
    # it would work. Let's try to force an import or re-import here.

    # The import 'from headsetcontrol_tray import __main__ as hct_main' already happened.
    # To test the install on import, we'd need to structure the test differently,
    # perhaps by un-importing and re-importing, or ensuring the patch is active *before*
    # the first import of the module under test.

    # A simpler approach for this specific case:
    # If the `verboselogs.install()` is indeed at the top level of `__main__.py`,
    # it would have been called when `hct_main` was first imported by Python for this test suite.
    # We can assert it was called.
    # This relies on the import order and test discovery of pytest.

    # Re-importing hct_main to ensure the patched verboselogs.install is called
