# ADR 0003: Use Direct HID Communication

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to choose a method for communicating with headsets. The method should be cross-platform and not rely on proprietary drivers or software.

## Decision

We have decided to use direct HID communication.

## Consequences

### Positive

*   **Cross-platform:** HID is a standard protocol that is supported by all major operating systems.
*   **No Proprietary Drivers:** Direct HID communication does not require any proprietary drivers or software.
*   **Wide Device Support:** Direct HID communication can be used to communicate with a wide range of devices, including headsets, keyboards, and mice.

### Negative

*   **Low-Level:** HID is a low-level protocol, which means that it can be more complex to work with than a higher-level API.
*   **Device-Specific:** Each headset model has its own unique set of HID reports, which means that the application needs to be updated to support new models.
