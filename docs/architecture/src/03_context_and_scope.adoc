The `headsetcontrol-tray` application is a user-facing desktop application that interacts with the operating system to provide a system tray icon and to access HID devices. The primary interaction is between the user and the application, allowing the user to control their headset. The application's core functionality is to send and receive HID reports to and from the connected headset.

=== Technical Context

The application runs on the user's local machine and interacts with the following external systems:

*   **Headset (HID Device):** The application communicates with the headset over USB using the HID protocol. It sends control commands and receives status updates.
*   **Operating System:** The application relies on the operating system for several functions:
    *   **GUI:** The application uses the operating system's windowing system to display its user interface (via PySide6).
    *   **System Tray:** The application creates a system tray icon for quick access.
    *   **Device Management:** The application uses the operating system's device management capabilities to detect and connect to HID devices. On Linux, this involves `udev`.

=== Scope

The application's scope is to provide a user-friendly GUI for controlling headset features. The following features are in scope:

*   Displaying headset status (e.g., battery level, connection status).
*   Controlling equalizer presets.
*   Adjusting sidetone and chatmix levels.
*   Saving and loading configuration settings.
*   Support for multiple headset models.

The following features are out of scope:

*   Firmware updates.
*   Audio processing or routing.
*   Support for non-HID devices.
*   Mobile or web-based interfaces.
