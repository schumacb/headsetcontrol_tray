== Quality Requirements

This section describes the quality requirements for the `headsetcontrol-tray` application.

=== Usability

The application must be intuitive and easy to use for non-technical users. The following are the specific requirements for usability:

*   The system tray icon must provide quick access to essential features, such as changing the equalizer preset and adjusting the sidetone level.
*   The settings dialog must be well-organized and self-explanatory.
*   The application must provide clear and concise feedback to the user, such as notifications when the headset is connected or disconnected.
*   The application must have a clean and modern user interface.

=== Extensibility

The architecture should make it easy to add support for new headset models and new features. The following are the specific requirements for extensibility:

*   The application must use a modular design, with a clear separation between the core application logic, the user interface, and the hardware-specific communication protocols.
*   The application must use a configuration file to define the HID reports for each supported headset model. This makes it easy to add support for new models without modifying the code.
*   The application must provide a clear and well-documented API for adding new features.

=== Portability

The application must be able to run on Windows, macOS, and Linux. The following are the specific requirements for portability:

*   The code must be written in a platform-agnostic way whenever possible.
*   Any platform-specific code must be isolated in a dedicated OS layer.
*   The application must use a cross-platform GUI toolkit, such as PySide6.

=== Reliability

The application must be reliable and not crash or hang. The following are the specific requirements for reliability:

*   The application must handle errors gracefully and provide clear error messages to the user.
*   The application must be tested thoroughly to ensure that it is free of bugs.
*   The application must not consume excessive system resources, such as CPU or memory.

=== Maintainability

The codebase must be easy to understand, modify, and test. The following are the specific requirements for maintainability:

*   The code must be well-documented, with clear and concise comments.
*   The code must follow a consistent coding style.
*   The code must have a high level of test coverage.
*   The code must be organized into logical modules and packages.
