== Solution Strategy

This section describes the overall solution strategy for the `headsetcontrol-tray` application.

=== Guiding Principles

The design of the application is guided by the following principles:

*   **Modularity:** The application is divided into distinct modules with well-defined responsibilities. This makes the codebase easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
*   **Separation of Concerns:** The application's concerns are separated into different layers. For example, the user interface is separate from the business logic, and the hardware communication is separate from the core application logic.
*   **Platform Abstraction:** Platform-specific code is isolated in a dedicated OS layer to improve portability and reduce code duplication.
*   **Configuration over Code:** The application uses a configuration file to store user settings and headset-specific information. This makes it easier to customize the application without modifying the code.

=== Key Design Choices

The following are the key design choices that shape the architecture:

*   **Desktop Application:** The application is a desktop application with a graphical user interface, rather than a command-line tool or a web application. This is because the target users are non-technical and prefer a visual interface.
*   **System Tray Icon:** The application uses a system tray icon as the primary user interface. This allows the application to run in the background and provide quick access to essential features.
*   **Direct HID Communication:** The application communicates with headsets directly using the HID protocol. This avoids the need for proprietary drivers or software and allows the application to support a wide range of devices.
*   **Python and PySide6:** The application is written in Python with the PySide6 library for the user interface. Python was chosen for its readability, extensive libraries, and cross-platform support. PySide6 was chosen for its modern API and good integration with Python.

=== Technology Stack

The application is built using the following technologies:

*   **Programming Language:** Python 3.10+
*   **GUI Toolkit:** PySide6
*   **HID Communication:** The `hidapi` library
*   **Package Management:** `uv`
*   **Build System:** `setuptools`
*   **Testing:** `pytest`
*   **Linting and Formatting:** `ruff`
*   **Static Typing:** `mypy`
