== Introduction and Goals

=== Requirements Overview

This document outlines the architecture of the `headsetcontrol-tray` application. The application is a system tray utility for controlling SteelSeries headsets, and potentially other brands, through direct HID communication. It provides a graphical user interface for features commonly found in command-line tools like `headsetcontrol`.

The primary goal of this project is to offer a user-friendly, cross-platform tool for managing headset settings, such as equalizer presets, chatmix, and sidetone, without relying on official manufacturer software, which is often proprietary and not available on all operating systems.

.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
(with version number and information where to find it).

.Motivation
From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-1/[Introduction and Goals] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Quality Goals

The top quality goals for the architecture are:

*   **Usability:** The application must be intuitive and easy to use for non-technical users. The system tray icon should provide quick access to essential features, and the settings dialog should be well-organized and self-explanatory.
*   **Extensibility:** The architecture should make it easy to add support for new headset models and new features. This will be achieved through a modular design, with clear separation between the core application logic, the user interface, and the hardware-specific communication protocols.
*   **Portability:** The application must be able to run on Windows, macOS, and Linux. The code should be written in a platform-agnostic way whenever possible, with any platform-specific code isolated in a dedicated OS layer.

The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. 
We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals.
They are not necessarily identical.

Consider this overview of potential topics (based upon the ISO 25010 standard):

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. 
Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...

=== Stakeholders

[options="header",cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Role/Name|Contact|Expectations
|End Users|N/A|A stable, easy-to-use application to control their headset features on their preferred operating system.
|Developers|N/A|A well-documented, maintainable codebase that is easy to contribute to. Clear separation of concerns and a consistent coding style are important.
|Maintainers|N/A|A robust architecture that minimizes technical debt and allows for easy updates and bug fixes. The documentation should be up-to-date and comprehensive.

.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* should know the architecture
* have to be convinced of the architecture
* have to work with the architecture or with code
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.
