== Deployment View

This section describes the deployment of the `headsetcontrol-tray` application.

=== Deployment Diagram

The following diagram shows the deployment of the application on a user's machine.

The application is deployed on the user's machine. It requires Python 3.10+ and `uv` to be installed. It uses the `libhidapi` library to communicate with the headset. The application itself runs in the user space and controls the headset, which is a separate hardware device.

=== Installation

The installation instructions are in the main `README.md` file.

=== System Requirements

The system requirements are in the main `README.md` file.

=== Configuration

The application is configured using a JSON file located in the user's configuration directory. The file is created automatically on the first run. The user can edit this file to customize the application's behavior and add support for new headsets.

=== Building a Distributable Package

While the primary installation method is from source, the project can be packaged into a distributable format (e.g., a standalone executable or an installer) using tools like PyInstaller or cx_Freeze. This is not yet officially supported, but it is a goal for the future.
