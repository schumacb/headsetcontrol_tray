== Technical Risks

This section identifies and documents the technical risks for the `headsetcontrol-tray` application.

[options="header",cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Risk|Description|Mitigation
|Device Compatibility|Each headset model has its own unique set of HID reports. If a headset is not supported, the application will not be able to communicate with it.|The application uses a configuration file to define the HID reports for each supported headset model. This makes it easy to add support for new models without modifying the code. The application also provides a clear error message to the user if a headset is not supported.
|Platform-Specific Issues|The application needs to run on Windows, macOS, and Linux. There may be platform-specific issues that are difficult to debug and fix.|The application uses an OS layer to isolate platform-specific code. This makes it easier to debug and fix platform-specific issues. The application is also tested on all three platforms to ensure that it works correctly.
|HID API Changes|The `hidapi` library may change in the future, which could break the application.|The application uses a wrapper around the `hidapi` library to isolate the low-level HID communication code. This makes it easier to update the code if the `hidapi` library changes.
|GUI Toolkit Issues|The PySide6 library may have bugs or limitations that affect the application.|The application is tested thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly with the PySide6 library. If any issues are found, they are reported to the PySide6 developers.
|Community Contributions|The project relies on community contributions for development and maintenance. If the community loses interest, the project may become stagnant.|The project is well-documented and has a clear contribution process. This makes it easy for new contributors to get involved. The project also has a core team of maintainers who are committed to the long-term success of the project.
