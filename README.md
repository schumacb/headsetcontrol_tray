# HeadsetControl Tray

A system tray application for controlling headsets, particularly those compatible with `headsetcontrol`.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- `uv` (a fast Python package installer and resolver)

### Installing `uv`

You can install `uv` using pip:

```bash
pip install uv
```

Alternatively, you can use the official installer script:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Make sure to add `uv` to your PATH if it's not already. If you installed with `pip` as a user, this might be `~/.local/bin`.

### Development Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Initialize the project and create a virtual environment:**
    If you are setting up the project for the first time using `uv`, it can initialize the project structure. However, since you've cloned an existing project, you'll primarily use `uv` to manage the environment and dependencies.

    Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    uv venv
    ```
    This will create a `.venv` directory in the project root.

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    On macOS and Linux:
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
    On Windows:
    ```bash
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**
    The project dependencies are defined in `pyproject.toml`. To install them using `uv`:
    ```bash
    uv pip sync
    ```
    If the project uses extras, you might use:
    ```bash
    uv pip sync --all-extras
    ```

5.  **Adding new dependencies:**
    To add a new runtime dependency:
    ```bash
    uv add <package-name>
    ```
    To add a new development dependency:
    ```bash
    uv add --dev <package-name>
    ```
    This will update your `pyproject.toml` and install the package.

### Running the Application

To run the application:

```bash
python -m headsetcontrol_tray
```

Alternatively, you can use `uv` to run scripts defined in `pyproject.toml` (if any) or execute commands within the managed environment:

```bash
uv run python -m headsetcontrol_tray
```
